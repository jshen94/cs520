CODE REVIEW

1. A large amount of code is repeated in testing the state of the game after each move is made. 
Player 1 and Player 2 essentially use the same code for testing for a winner, but the code is repeated.
To fix this I would create a separate method for checking for a winner, and parameterize the inputs such that the method will be able to efficiently check for a winner.
One way to do this would be to sum up the possible winning conditions, and if they equal a certain number then declare a winner.


2. There is no encapsulation for testing, debugging and readability, the entire game is written into one class. 
 To fix this, I would split the game into the three components for Model View and Controller,
  and also create classes for simpler, yet still important components such as the board and player classes.


3. Many of the variables are public when there is no need for them to be public.
I would create private variables and create getters/setters for them if they are needed by other classes.
